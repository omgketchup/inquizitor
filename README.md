Inquizitor is an app that allows you to create a "quiz" and the questions in it, and you can share it with others. You can use it as a poll, and simply collect the results, or you can use it as a quiz or a test, where you create an answer key, and you can view scores.  

Installation is easy. The only pre-req here is Node.js and the Node Package Manager. For help installing node and npm, visit nodejs.com.
git clone https://github.com/omgketchup/inquizitor.git
cd inquizitor
npm install
node app

Please Note: This is a work-in-progress, and kind of me just experimenting with express, angular, and mongodb.
